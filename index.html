	<h1> "Skateboard Legends"</h1>
	<h2><em>Defined by a true skate rat</em></h2>
	<h3> There have been many great skaters in history, but few will ever enter the glorious pantheon of shred I put before you now.These names will live forever and influence what style, innovation, and gnar really are for generations to come. People will say there are better skaters outhere (nyjah) and that they should be on this list, but this is a list of the greatest skateboard legends not the best. Big difference kook!</h3>

	<p>Disposable heroes are made every day, but true pioneers come along once a generation.<br/> In the world of modern skateboarding, that man is Rodney Mullen. He is known as the godfather of street skating, and is one of the most prolific and influential skateboarders in history. Rodney's recieved his first skateboard in 1977 at the age of 10. That same year he entered his first contest and came in third; then, over the next three years, he would place first in every contest he entered -- nearly thirty in all. In 1980, after winning the Oasis Pro competition in San Diego, Rodney began his professional skating career with the Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade. He is credited for inventing numerous tricks, including the flatground ollie, kickflip, heelflip, impossible, and 360-flip."</p>

	<p>British skating legend Tom Penny grew up in the tranquil Oxfordshire village of Abingdon, he went on to conquer the US skate scene, landing never-seen-before tricks with such ease and nonchalance that entire skate world immediately sat up and took notice.<br/>


	He was born on 13th April 1977 and began skateboarding at an early age in Oxford – with no magazines, DVDs or YouTube to influence him, Tom soon developed his own, unique style. He began popping up in skateboard magazines and videos, and was spotted by Oxford’s SS20 skateshop, and then Deathbox Skateboards, leading to an appearance in the first Flip video The Long Overdue in 1993.<br/>

	After relocating to the States with Flip in 1994, he appeared in videos such as Flip’s Sorry, Really Sorry and Extremely Sorry. However, his legacy is longer-lasting that any one video part. His style has influenced street skateing and made us all want to ride with more steez.

	Tom was never into skateboarding for the fame or money, and he periodically disappears from the scene to recharge his batteries by doing tai chi and meditation. In recent years, he has had spells living in Argentina, Barcelona, Copenhagen, the UK, and the USA, all of which has added to the legend that has built up around him.</p>

	<div class="skaters"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gonzales" target="_blank">Mark Gonzalez</strong></div></a>

	<p>Gonzales entered the skateboarding scene at the age of thirteen in South Gate, California, U.S. At the age of fifteen, as Tommy Guerrero and Natas Kaupas were developing their own styles of progressive street skating around the same time, Gonzales adopted a more modern, innovative approach to skateboarding in a street context.<br/> He was featured on the cover of Thrasher magazine’s November 1984 issue riding a board from the Alva company, his board sponsor at the time. Shortly after his Thrasher magazine cover, Gonzales then joined the Vision skateboard team and quickly attained the status of a “professional” skateboarder.<br/> Gonzales won the 1985 Oceanside street contest while sponsored by Vision. Gonzales proceeded to further influence the progression of street skateboarding with the 1991 Blind Skateboards video Video Days (a company he formed with Steve Rocco in 1989)</p>

	<div class="skaters"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Milton" target="_blank">Kennan Milton</strong></div></a>
	
	<p>Keenan Milton (August 4, 1974 – July 5, 2001)[1] was an American professional skateboarder from Atlanta Georgia. His sponsors included DVS Shoes, Chocolate skateboards, and Blind.

	Keenan was the second child of nine children born to single-parent Phyllis Patterson. He had four brothers and four sisters. His mother died in 1991. Keenan was raised in Harlem, New York, by his grandmother, Georgia Patterson, who died in May 2008.

	In 2001, he accidentally drowned at an Independence Day party. Upon his death memorial and funeral services were held in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, and Savannah, Georgia. Even after his death, old footage of Keenan has been used in several videos. The introduction to the videos Yeah Right! and Pretty Sweet features a tribute to him[citation needed].

	Hip hop musician Murs says "Rest in peace, Keenan Milton/Keep ridin" in his song "Transitions as a Rider" from the soundtrack to the film Rising Son: The Legend of Skateboarder Christian Hosoi.[2][3]

	Musician Devendra Banhart included a song called "The Ballad of Keenan Milton" on his 2013 album, Mala.</p>

	<div class="skaters"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cardiel" target="_blank">John Cardiel</div></a>

	<p>Ask any skateboarder to describe John Cardiel and the most commonly used word is Legend.

	Cardiel was known for being fast and fearless. In 1992, he was named Skateboarder of the Year by Thrasher Magazine. In 2011, Transworld Skate Magazine named Cardiel the 11th most influential skateboarder of all time.<br/>Writing for Transworld Skateboarding in 1993, Simon Woodstock explained his perspective on Cardiel's influence on skateboarding at the time: "The mark John is making on the skate scene is like a terminal illness. He can never be cured and he just won't go away. John is just 100 percent balls out all the time, and he is destined to win and become a legend in his own time. If cojones were measured by the size of eggs, John Cardiel's would be those of an ostrich."[12] </p>
